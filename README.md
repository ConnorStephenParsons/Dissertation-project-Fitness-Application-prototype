# Dissertation-project-Fitness-Application-prototype
For my final year University Dissertation I created a fitness application fucusing on UX and UI, which puts user preferences at the heart of the exercise creation process. It features a series of user based preference selections which then gives the user a workout based on their interests, needs, goals, enjoyment, time, location, and accessibility. I have provided a link in README file for a simulation of this application.
